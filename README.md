Project name: Check my pic

Stage 1

Great job developing the webpage!
Now to the existing webpage, add a click counter. Every time I click on the image, the counter should increase.
And this is something that I would like to see it myself, I want you to use Github pages to host the application.

Bonus: Add a way to retain the counter after reloading the webpage as well.
