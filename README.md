Stage 3

Congrats on finishing a good responsive website.:+1:üèª:heart_eyes:.
For our next stage, I want your webapp to take a list of URLs from a JSON file and generate and an image gallery like above. Each file should retain it's clicker count but need not show it in the webpage anymore.
The clicker count will be updated every time user opens an image.
The images should be able to be sorted by most visited and least visited.
Integrate build tools such as webpack and use Airbnb javascript style guide for coding conventions.

Bonus: Use Animations for scrolling, opening the images and closing the images. Different grids for tabs, mobile and desktop.
