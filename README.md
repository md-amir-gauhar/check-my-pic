Stage 2

You have successfully got your hands dirty by working with HTML, CSS and JS. :heart_eyes::blush:. You have started your journey to be a front end developer. You deserve an applause for taking the time. :clap:üèº.
Now, coming to our webpage, I want you to add a new image with it's own clicker count. 
Let's work on making our webpage more user friendly as well.
Add title and a caption below the pictures. Use semantic tags to make the HTML code more easier to read.
Also give unique id to the elements. 

Bonus: Make the webpage responsive. The design choice is yours on how you want to make them look like. Use your creativity.
